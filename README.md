"What's on my Shelf?"

A Fall 2025 Senior Project
MSU Denver

## Getting Started

What's on my Shelf is designed to be a food restocking inventory system. The goals of our algorithm are as follows:

1.	The algorithm will collect data on the user's current inventory, items they are using more often, and the pricing of items from different brands.
2.	The algorithm will keep track of how quickly each item purchased is being used.
3.	The algorithm will be configurable with restocking thresholds to keep track of how much of an item you have left.
4.	The algorithm will have item prioritization that will also be configurable.
5.	The algorithm will be able to keep track of how much of an item needs to be purchased if the user is using more of an ingredient.
6.	The algorithm will format all of this information into a grocery list that the user can edit and manage.
7.	The algorithm will remove items from the user's inventory when recipes are being made.
8.	Over time, the algorithm will become refined with more data and communication from the user.

The goal of this project is to create an application for home cooks who look to save money, reduce waste, and prevent overstock.
What’s on my Shelf is an automated restocking engine that makes all of your food inventory easy to maintain, refresh, and manage.
